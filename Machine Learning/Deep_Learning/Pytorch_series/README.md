# PyTorch Implementation

This repo contains:

>> implementing CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU from scratch with Pytorch.

>> Creating Dataset to train a Model.

>> Data Augmentation Techniques.

>> Trainig a INstance Segmentation Network by Fine-Tuning Mask-RCNN.

Future addition:
>> Object Detection using YOLOv4.

>> Object Classification.

>> Other PyTorch basic concepts.

In case any doubt related to concept, try directly refering to PyTorch's original Documentation.
