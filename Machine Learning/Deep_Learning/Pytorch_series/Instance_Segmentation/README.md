# Mask R-CNN Implementation with PyTorch

The dataset for this task can directly be downloaded by running the code cell and unzipping it.

All the details related to performing the task have been explained in this [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@mohit_gaikwad/mask-r-cnn-implementation-with-pytorch-4aeb210ee9b7).
Mask R-CNN research [paper review post](https://medium.com/@mohit_gaikwad/review-mask-r-cnn-f395b46499fb).

Apart from the code in the post, changes that can be made are:
1. Using a different Optimizer.
2. Using a different predictor head.
3. Using different data augmentation techniques.
4. Trying out different hyperparameters.
5. Training for more number of epochs.

Please fork this repo and figure out what more updates could be done to the code for achieveing better mAP.
